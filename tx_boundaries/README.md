## Source Data

Source shapefiles are in `/source`. Source files were downloaded from the (now deprecated) "National Atlas of the United States" of the United States Department of the Interior. Due to the age and deprecation, it is highly recommended this data be used for visual display and mapping purposes only and not for detailed analysis.
